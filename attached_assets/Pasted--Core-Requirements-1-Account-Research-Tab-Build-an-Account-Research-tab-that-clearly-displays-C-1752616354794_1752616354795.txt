 Core Requirements
âœ… 1. Account Research Tab
Build an Account Research tab that clearly displays:

Core Technology Systems:

Clearly list relevant core technologies (Salesforce, SAP S/4, SAP ECC, MS Dynamics, MS CE, MS AX, MS BO, MS D365, Oracle EBS, Oracle ECC, JD Edwards, etc.).

SCIPAB/SPIN Framework Analysis:

Clearly highlight this analysis in an organized format that sales reps can easily review.

Hypothesis on Key Metrics:

Clearly articulate a hypothesis about which business metrics or KPIs this particular account likely prioritizes or cares about most.

âœ… 2. Leads & Contacts Tab
Build a separate Leads & Contacts tab that allows sales reps to explore individual contacts within an account and easily access tailored outreach strategies:

Contact Tree View:

Display all relevant leads/contacts organized neatly in a clear, collapsible tree structure.

Allow sales reps to quickly navigate and select individual contacts.

Generated Personalized Communications:

For each selected lead/contact, automatically display two types of personalized messaging:

A Sample Email tailored specifically to the selected contact.

A Sample LinkedIn Message tailored to the selected contact's professional role and presumed interests.
