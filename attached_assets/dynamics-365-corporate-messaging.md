Example:
"Every Dynamics update cycle carries $4.7M in downtime risk—yet 73% of Finance & Operations teams still rely on manual regression testing. The hidden cost? 30-50% of QA resources tied up in test maintenance while critical business functions wait for stable deployments. What would happen if your next F&O update shipped 5× faster without compromising financial compliance?"
