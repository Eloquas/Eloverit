## 3. Cold‑Outbound Sequence (6 touches) 📧  

> **Campaign ID:** `MSD365‑Cold‑6`  

### Email 1 — “Numbers executives notice”  
**Subject:** `{{company}} & $4.7 M nobody budgets for`  

Hi {{first}},  

99.9 % uptime still means **8.76 hours** of Dynamics downtime a year—≈**\$4.7 M** slipping out the door.  
Teams that replaced manual tests with Avo’s self‑healing automation cut those outages in half while shipping **5 × faster**.  

**What’s the single failure you never want to see in your next update cycle?**  

---

### Email 2 — “Velocity in real numbers”  
**Subject:** `5× faster QA isn’t hype`  

The last F&O release we touched shrank its full regression window from 10 days to 2—**5 ×** faster—without adding head‑count.  
That freed **640 engineering hours** in a single quarter.  

Curious which test suites you’d automate first at {{company}}?  

---

### Email 3 — “The maintenance drain”  
**Subject:** `30‑50 % less script upkeep`  

Dynamics updates break scripts; engineers patch them.  
Our AI‑driven “self‑heal” slices that burden by **30‑50 %**.  

Where could that reclaimed time move your roadmap forward?  

---

### Email 4 — “Why CFOs quiz QA on OPEX”  
**Subject:** `QA’s hidden \$1 M OPEX lever`  

Avo customers report **\$1 M‑plus** annual OPEX cuts from reduced manual testing. Finance notices.  

How does QA show up in {{company}}’s FY‑26 cost‑take‑out plan?  

---

### Email 5 — “Social proof”  
**Subject:** `Customer story: 0 Sev‑1s post‑go‑live`  

A Fortune 250 D365 shop rolled updates to 27 countries with **zero** production defects after automating 3 600 scenarios.  

Which module rollout keeps you up at night—Finance, SCM, or CE?  

---

### Email 6 — “Future‑state vision”  
**Subject:** `What would progress look like by Aug 31?`  

If in six weeks you could green‑light one metric—downtime, velocity, or OPEX—what would it be?  

Happy to swap notes or send a 3‑min teardown, whichever saves you time.
