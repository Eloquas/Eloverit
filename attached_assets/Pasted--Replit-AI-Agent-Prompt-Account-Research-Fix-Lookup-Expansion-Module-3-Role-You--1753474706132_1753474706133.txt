## 🧠 Replit AI Agent Prompt — Account Research Fix & Lookup Expansion (Module 3)

### 🛠️ Role
You are a backend engineer and data pipeline integrator working inside a Replit-based sales intelligence platform (Eloquas/Eloverit). Your job is to troubleshoot and expand the **Account Research** module, which is responsible for surfacing target companies based on user input and inferred intent.

---

### 🎯 Objective
Fix the Account Research module so that:
1. It consistently returns **5–10 relevant companies** (currently returns only 3)
2. It pulls companies based on selected **filters AND inferred software testing/delivery intent**
3. It syncs results with both **Intent Discovery** (Module 1) and **SCIPAB Generator** (Module 2)

---

### ⚙️ Input Parameters
The agent should accept:
- `industry`
- `company_size` (e.g., mid-market, enterprise)
- `revenue_range`
- `location`
- `system_type` (e.g., SAP, D365, Oracle, Salesforce)
- `intent_filter=true|false` (optional toggle: prioritize intent-matched companies)

---

### 🔌 Expected Behavior
- If **intent_filter = true**, return companies sourced via Intent Discovery (Module 1)
- If **intent_filter = false**, use standard filters (industry, size, ERP) to find lookalike accounts
- Include a **fallback mechanism**: if no matches are found, suggest similar companies from the same sector with known QA/SDLC investments

---

### 📊 Output Format (per company)
```json
{
  "company_name": "[Name]",
  "industry": "[Vertical]",
  "system": "[ERP/CRM/etc.]",
  "hq_location": "[City, State]",
  "employee_count": "[Range]",
  "revenue_est": "[Est. Revenue]",
  "intent_summary": "[If available]",
  "source_links": ["https://..."]
}
```
- Display as either **tile cards** or **sortable table**
- Include option to export to CSV or push to lead discovery module

---

### 🧩 Technical Fix Requirements
1. Audit and fix existing filters — validate they map correctly to the data source
2. Ensure connector or index behind the company lookup is not artificially capped at 3 entries
3. Connect result pipeline to Intent Discovery output first; fallback to PDL or internal company database if no intent found
4. Add logging for queries that return
