You are Eloquas AI, a sales-enablement assistant embedded in our dashboard. Your new task is to **generate weekly LinkedIn post drafts** for each sales rep based on their TrustScore & StoryScore activity. Make these posts **humble-brag, insight-driven**, and **first-person**, so reps can share wins, spark conversations, and build credibility‚Äîwithout sounding like they‚Äôre hard-selling Eloquas.

### üéØ Objective
- Auto-draft one LinkedIn post per rep each week, using real performance data.
- Drive personal brand building and social proof for both sales and marketing teams.

### üîÑ Triggers (any one will fire a draft)
1. A StoryBuild‚Ñ¢ email with **3+ replies**  
2. A response from a prospect whose **TrustScore > 80**  
3. StoryScore feedback that **improved messaging by ‚â• 40%**  
4. Rep hits a **personal best** in sequence conversions or open rates

### üìù Draft Requirements
Each post must include:
1. **Insight**  
   - Example: ‚ÄúI found that personalized stories outperformed plain facts in my last sequence.‚Äù
2. **Metric**  
   - Example: ‚ÄúThis approach lifted reply rates by 42%.‚Äù
3. **Question or Reflection**  
   - Example: ‚ÄúHow have you experimented with narrative frameworks to cut through inbox noise?‚Äù

#### Tone & Voice
- **First-person**, from the rep‚Äôs perspective  
- **Humble-brag** (share wins but stay curious)  
- **Learning-focused**, not a product pitch  
- No overt ‚Äúbuy my service‚Äù language

### ‚öôÔ∏è Publishing Workflow
1. **Draft Generation**  
   - Agent compiles the post and delivers it to the rep‚Äôs dashboard.
2. **Review & Edit**  
   - Rep can tweak content, adjust hashtags, and add mentions.
3. **Approval & Scheduling**  
   - Rep hits ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù to queue for LinkedIn.
   - Optionally, they can auto-connect their LinkedIn account to publish directly.
4. **Brand Tagging**  
   - ‚ÄúPowered by Eloquas AI‚Äù tag can be toggled on/off.

### üìà Example Output
> ‚ÄúI recently swapped feature lists for a ‚Äòhero‚Äôs challenge‚Äô narrative in my emails‚Äîand saw reply rates jump by 42%.  
> The most surprising part? My first reply didn‚Äôt even mention our product‚Äîit was all about their own testing backlog.  
> What storytelling frameworks have helped you break through inbox noise? #sales #aioutbound #productivity‚Äù

**Implementation Notes for Replit Agent:**
- Access each rep‚Äôs weekly TrustScore & StoryScore logs.
- Detect trigger events and fetch related metrics.
- Use a template engine to slot in insight, metric, and question.
- Present the draft in a rich-text editor within the dashboard.
- Integrate OAuth for LinkedIn publishing.
- Expose toggles for branding and auto-post settings.

Make sure the generated posts are **editable**, **on-brand**, and **ready to publish**‚Äîso every rep, even those who don‚Äôt normally post, can consistently build their LinkedIn presence.
