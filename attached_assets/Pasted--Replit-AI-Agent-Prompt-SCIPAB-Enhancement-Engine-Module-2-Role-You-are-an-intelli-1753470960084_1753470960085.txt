## ‚úçÔ∏è Replit AI Agent Prompt ‚Äî SCIPAB Enhancement Engine (Module 2)

### üõ†Ô∏è Role
You are an intelligent AI writing agent embedded in a Replit app (Eloquas/Eloverit). Your job is to improve the quality and context-awareness of the **SCIPAB framework generator**, which is used to craft highly personalized sales outreach messages. SCIPAB stands for **Situation, Complication, Implication, Position, Action, Benefit**.

---

### üéØ Objective
Enhance the current SCIPAB generator so it:
1. Pulls real-time data from the **Intent Discovery** engine (Module 1)
2. Tailors output to the specific company, system (e.g., Dynamics 365, SAP), and role (e.g., QA Manager, Director of IT)
3. Strengthens business case messaging, linking intent signals to test automation urgency

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Input Requirements
The agent should accept:
- `company_name`
- `industry`
- `role_title` (e.g., Director of QA, Head of IT Ops)
- `system_type` (e.g., Dynamics 365, Oracle)
- `intent_signal` (e.g., "migrating to Dynamics 365," "expanding Salesforce footprint")
- `pain_points` (optional: defaults pulled from database by industry + role)

---

### üß† Output Structure
Output must be a clean, complete SCIPAB block in Markdown:
```markdown
**SITUATION:** [Pull from company + intent]
**COMPLICATION:** [Tie change to QA/SDLC bottlenecks]
**IMPLICATION:** [Business risk from inefficient QA/testing coverage]
**POSITION:** [Introduce Avo Automation as no-code test platform]
**ACTION:** [Request time or share CTA]
**BENEFIT:** [Quantifiable outcome ‚Äî saved time, increased velocity, avoided bugs]
```

---

### üß© Smart Enhancements
1. If the company is **already in the Intent Discovery engine**, pull the summary and use it as the SITUATION.
2. If no intent exists, fallback to a **generic SITUATION** based on industry trends.
3. Make the POSITION section always mention that the platform is:
   - Recognized in Gartner‚Äôs Market Guide
   - Used by Fortune 500 teams for Dynamics 365, SAP, and 200+ technologies
   - Business-user-friendly (no-code)
4. If role is high-level (VP, Director, CXO), emphasize **risk and ROI**.
   If role is practitioner (QA Engineer, Manager), emphasize **efficiency and speed**.

---

### üì§ Output Formatting
- Always include full SCIPAB with headers.
- Allow single-click **copy**, **export to CSV**, or **push to Outreach tab**.
- Include a "Regenerate" button for fast iteration with slight tone shifts (formal, consultative, bold).

---

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- Test with: `company=New Balance`, `role=QA Manager`, `system=Dynamics 365`, `intent="Migrating to cloud-based ERP"`
- Ensure output is:
  - Personalized
  - Insightful
  - Uses real-world data when available
  - Aligned with Avo's value prop

---

Once complete, mark this module version as `SCIPAB_v1.5` and notify frontend to replace old generator with updated logic.
