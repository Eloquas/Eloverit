## üß† Replit AI Agent Prompt ‚Äî Fix & Rebuild Intent Discovery Engine

### üõ†Ô∏è Role
You are a backend+AI full-stack engineer working inside a Replit app called Eloquas (also branded as Eloverit). This platform is built to help sales teams identify high-intent accounts based on deep research models and public data signals. You will fix the **Intent Discovery Engine** which is currently broken.

---

### üéØ Objective
Fix and rebuild the **Intent Discovery** feature so that:
- It surfaces companies exhibiting **real buying intent** around SDLC/STLC initiatives.
- It uses an o3-based or similarly capable deep research model to identify intent from **indirect signals**, not just keyword matches.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Input Logic
The system should:
1. Accept filters from the user: Industry, Geography, Revenue, ERP/CRM System (e.g., Dynamics 365, SAP).
2. Search for public signals that indicate SDLC/STLC-related initiatives:
   - Migrations
   - Integrations
   - ERP/CRM Replacements
   - New application rollouts
   - QA or test automation investments
   - Layoffs/hiring in IT/QA roles
3. Use news articles, 10-Ks, investor releases, company blogs, earnings calls, and job postings to extract **intent signals**.
4. Use NER + NLP + intent classification to infer whether the initiative is high-value and time-sensitive.

---

### ‚úÖ Output Requirements
Each company should show a tile with:
- **Company Name**  
- **Intent Summary** (1‚Äì2 sentence description in natural language)
- **Matched Keywords/Phrases** (e.g., "migrating to Microsoft Dynamics 365")
- **Source Type** (e.g., Job Post, News Article)
- **Link to Original Source**
- **Confidence Score (0‚Äì100%)**

---

### üîå Technical Tasks
1. Fix the current error in the Intent Discovery module (returning no results and crashing).
2. Ensure the intent detection uses vector or semantic retrieval (not just keywords).
3. Add fallback: if no companies match exactly, show lookalike companies in the same vertical with similar initiatives.
4. Add sorting/filtering options by intent strength, recency, or company size.
5. Add a loader + error-handling message: "No intent found. Try a different filter or industry."

---

### üîÑ Integration Points
- Connect to Account Research module: Accounts that show up in Intent Discovery should auto-load into the Account Research tab.
- Connect to SCIPAB: Intent description should become the seed for Situation/Complication.
- Save results to user‚Äôs profile for export.

---

### üí° Design Suggestions
Keep the UX simple:
- Results shown as scrollable cards or table.
- Include option to export top 10 accounts as CSV.
- Use pagination if >25 results returned.

---

### üîç Optional Enhancements (Phase 2)
- Intent Trends heatmap by industry
- Visual timeline of intent activity for each company
- Slack/email alert when new intent matches user filters

---

Once complete, tag this module version as **IntentDiscovery_v1.5** and notify the frontend to wire into the Account Research and Outreach flows.

Let me know when this module is working and visible in staging or prod so we can proceed to Module 2: SCIPAB Intelligence Enhancement.
